# ActionFlow - Complaint Management System

ActionFlow is a web-based platform designed to streamline complaint resolution within an organization. It provides a structured workflow for users to submit complaints and for administrators and resolvers to manage, track, and resolve them efficiently.

## Key Features

*   **Multi-Organization Architecture:** Supports multiple organizations, each with its own isolated set of users, resolvers, and complaints.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Distinct dashboard and permissions for regular Users, organization Admins, and Resolvers.
*   **Complaint Lifecycle Management:** Track complaints from submission (`Pending`) to resolution (`Resolved`) and final closure (`Closed`).
*   **Automated Resolver Assignment:** High-priority complaints are automatically assigned to the least-loaded resolver in the relevant category.
*   **User Feedback System:** Users can provide ratings and feedback on resolved complaints.
*   **Responsive Design:** A clean, mobile-friendly interface for all users.
